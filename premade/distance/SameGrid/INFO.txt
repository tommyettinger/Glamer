The font files in this folder all contain the same glyphs (from space at
Unicode codepoint 32, up to and including tilde at Unicode codepoint 126), at
the same approximate sizes, and in the same positions on a grid. Each cell of
the grid is 62 pixels wide by 126 pixels tall, making each column also 62
pixels wide and each row 126 pixels tall. The grid starts at x=8,y=8 from
the upper left, and 8 should be added to each x or y component after
calculating the row and column starts.
You could use the different fonts as layers of a 3D texture to swap between
bold/italic/regular versions of one font or swap between different fonts to
help distinguish parts of a screen full of text. Though the glyphs should be
completely contained in their cells, the baselines might not match between
fonts, particularly the italic or oblique fonts when compared to regular or
bold fonts. Italic fonts tend to be smaller here because they hit the limit of
the width for a cell at a smaller size, so their height is smaller as well.
